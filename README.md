Things you may want to cover:

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

    [debase won't install with ruby 3.0.2](https://github.com/ruby-debug/debase/issues/94). This is needed for debugging. When fixed, run

    ```
